Roadmap: ZIP/RAR Brute-Forcer (Dictionary Attack)
1. Project Overview
Objective:
Develop a CLI-based tool that attempts to crack password-protected ZIP/RAR files using a wordlist-based dictionary attack.

Features:
âœ… Support for ZIP and RAR formats
âœ… Dictionary-based attack (uses wordlist.txt)
âœ… Multi-threading for faster brute-forcing
âœ… Optional logging of attempted passwords
âœ… Support for large files

2. Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
zipfile (for ZIP file handling)
rarfile (for RAR file handling)
threading (for multi-threading)
argparse (for CLI argument parsing)
3. Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Project Setup & Dependencies
âœ… Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install rarfile
âœ… Ensure unrar is installed (for RAR support):

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install unrar  # Linux
âœ… Download the wordlist file from GitHub:

Wordlist Repository
Extract wordlist.txt into the project directory
âœ… Set up the script structure

Phase 2: Read and Use the Wordlist File
Open wordlist.txt and read passwords line by line
Store passwords in a list or use a generator for memory efficiency
Implement a function to iterate through the passwords
âœ… Example Code Snippet:

python
Copy
Edit
def load_wordlist(wordlist_path):
    with open(wordlist_path, "r", encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore") as file:
        return [line.strip() for line in file]
ðŸ’¡ This function loads passwords from wordlist.txt

Phase 3: Implement ZIP Brute-Force
Use zipfile to open and try each password from wordlist.txt
If correct, print success message
Handle file errors and incorrect passwords
âœ… Using wordlist.txt:

python
Copy
Edit
passwords = load_wordlist("wordlist.txt")

for password in passwords:
    try:
        with zipfile.ZipFile("protected.zip") as zf:
            zf.extractall(pwd=password.encode())
            print(f"[+] Password found: {password}")
            break
    except RuntimeError:
        continue  # Incorrect password, move to next one
Phase 4: Implement RAR Brute-Force
Use rarfile to handle RAR files
Try passwords from wordlist.txt
Print the correct password when found
âœ… Using wordlist.txt for RAR Files:

python
Copy
Edit
import rarfile

passwords = load_wordlist("wordlist.txt")

for password in passwords:
    try:
        with rarfile.RarFile("protected.rar") as rf:
            rf.extractall(pwd=password)
            print(f"[+] Password found: {password}")
            break
    except rarfile.BadRarFile:
        continue  # Incorrect password, move to next one
Phase 5: Optimize with Multi-Threading
Implement multi-threading to test multiple passwords in parallel
Speeds up brute-forcing significantly
Phase 6: Final Testing & Edge Cases
Test with various ZIP/RAR file formats
Handle cases like empty wordlists, missing files, permission issues
Add error handling for corrupt archives
4. How to Use the Tool?
Command to Run
bash
Copy
Edit
python zip_rar_cracker.py -f protected.zip -w wordlist.txt
ðŸ’¡ This will try all passwords in wordlist.txt on protected.zip.

Expected Output
pgsql
Copy
Edit
[+] Password found: mypassword123
5. Future Enhancements
ðŸš€ Use GPU acceleration (e.g., hashcat) for faster brute-forcing
ðŸš€ Add a wordlist generator for password mutations
ðŸš€ Implement progress tracking to show percentage completed

Final Notes
Your wordlist.txt file will be used at Phase 2 to Phase 4, where the program iterates through it and tries each password on the ZIP/RAR file. Let me know if you need further modifications! ðŸ”¥
